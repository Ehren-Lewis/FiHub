# FiHub - 
 FiHub
## Description

FiHub was created with the idea to use some of the top API's to provide valuable information, primarily for stocks and cryptocurrencies, for interested users. The FiHub project challenged all of its collaborators by applying new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and much more. Additionally, this was a learning opportunity for creating applications in a group setting, using GitHub, with the main focus of working in different branches.

The work involved for this project was split into two main categories based on application content: Cryptocurrency and Stocks. Within these two categories, the collaborators chose to mostly focus on either CSS style/static HTML content, DOM manipulation with JS, or JS API calls. The remainder of the application work was divided to whomever was able to take on the work. Collaborators also assisted each other with their chosen work as needed.
